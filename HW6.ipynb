    "\n",
    "2. Plotting Data in `plotly`:\n",
    "   - `plotly.express` with `trendline='ols'`: Automatically adds a fitted regression line, suitable for visualizing trends when modeling the data.\n",
    "   - `plotly.graph_objects` without trendline: Preferred for purely visualizing raw data distribution without fitting a trend line, providing greater control over the plot‚Äôs content.\n",
    "   - For situations where the focus is on the raw data, `plotly.graph_objects` is recommended, as it avoids implying a fitted model.\n",

    "\n",
    "1  Objective: To investigate if there is a relationship between the duration of geyser eruptions and the waiting time between eruptions, specifically within short wait times (less than certain thresholds).\n",
    "\n",
    "2  Methodology:\n",
    "   We used a filtered dataset of geyser eruptions, focusing on \"short wait times\" defined by thresholds of 62, 64, and 66 minutes.\n",
    "   For each threshold, we ran an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with `duration` as the dependent variable and `waiting` as the independent variable.\n",
    "   We examined the p-values and coefficients from each regression to assess if `waiting` significantly impacts `duration` within these shorter intervals.\n",
    "   A scatter plot with a regression trendline was generated to visualize the relationship for each short wait threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3  Key Findings:\n",
    "    Significance: The p-values for `waiting` were very low in each regression (well below 0.05), indicating a statistically significant relationship between `waiting` and `duration` within short wait times. This result provides evidence against the null hypothesis (which assumed no relationship).\n",
    "    Relationship Pattern: The coefficients for `waiting` were positive (around 0.03 to 0.05) across different thresholds, suggesting that even within short wait times, longer wait times are associated with longer eruption durations.\n",
    "   Consistency with Full Dataset: The positive relationship within short wait times mirrors the trend observed in the full dataset, where longer wait times generally lead to longer eruption durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4  Conclusion: The analysis shows that even for shorter wait times, there is evidence of a positive relationship between eruption duration and waiting time, similar to the trend in the full dataset. This indicates that the duration of geyser eruptions depends on the time waited, regardless of whether we look at the full dataset or only at shorter waiting intervals."

    "1)Previous Model Specifications:\n",
    "   The initial model, 'smf.ols('duration ~ waiting', data=old_faithful)', uses waiting time as a continuous predictor, assuming a linear relationship with duration. This model provides a general slope for the impact of waiting time on duration without considering variations between ‚Äúshort‚Äù and ‚Äúlong‚Äù wait times.\n",
    "   The next two models, 'smf.ols('duration ~ waiting', data=old_faithful[short_wait])'and 'smf.ols('duration ~ waiting', data=old_faithful[long_wait])', analyze duration separately within \"short\" and \"long\" wait times, revealing potential differences within these groups but lacking direct comparability between them within the same framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)New Model Specification with Indicator Variable\n",
    "    The new model introduces an indicator variable for wait time categories, dividing them as ‚Äúshort‚Äù (<68 minutes) and ‚Äúlong‚Äù (‚â•68 minutes). By using 'C(kind, Treatment(reference=\"short\"))', with \"short\" as the baseline, this model facilitates a direct comparison across the two groups. The indicator variable highlights whether the wait time falls into the ‚Äúlong‚Äù category, making it easier to examine differences in eruption duration based on wait time classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Big Picture\n",
    "   This model differs from the previous ones by treating waiting time as a categorical variable, allowing for a clear comparison between ‚Äúshort‚Äù and ‚Äúlong‚Äù wait times. This specification aligns directly with the goal of determining if eruption durations vary systematically between these categories, which was less straightforward in prior continuous-only models."
